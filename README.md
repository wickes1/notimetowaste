# No Time To Waste

## Why

Are you tired of endlessly researching and planning before diving into something new? Do you find yourself getting caught up in finding the perfect resources or the best way to learn? If so, you're not alone. I used to waste a lot of time on these activities without making much progress.

This repository is a reflection of my journey into the world of computers. It's a reminder to myself—and to anyone else who can relate—that there's no time to waste on:

- Imagining whether a tech will suit you or not
- Guessing the best way to learn something
- Searching for the best resources
- Repeating the same thing over and over again
- Remembering the best practices and things I've learned
- So let's stop overthinking and start doing. Dive in, explore, and keep moving forward.

## What's Included

This repository will cover everything that has piqued my interest along the way. From programming languages to software development methodologies, expect to find a diverse range of topics discussed here.

Feel free to contribute your own insights, resources, or experiences. Together, let's embrace the journey of learning and growth.
